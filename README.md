# AI-Enhanced BFT Consensus Mechanism

This repository demonstrates a proof-of-concept (PoC) for an **AI-Enhanced Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)** consensus mechanism. The project integrates Machine Learning (ML) with blockchain consensus to predict node behavior, optimize leader selection, and simulate a consensus round.

## Features
- **AI-Driven Node Analysis**: Predicts whether a node is honest or malicious based on behavior data.
- **Leader Selection**: Dynamically selects the most suitable leader using AI predictions and stake evaluation.
- **Consensus Simulation**: Simulates a simple consensus round to demonstrate the functionality.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Used for rapid prototyping and integrating AI/ML components.
- **scikit-learn**: For training and evaluating the AI model.
- **Random Forest**: Core AI model for node behavior prediction.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-bft-consensus.git
   cd ai-bft-consensus
2. Install depemndencies
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Train the AI model and run the consensus simulation:
   `python main.py`
2. The script outputs:
- AI model training accuracy
- Selected leader node based on AI predictions
- Results of the consensus round

## Dataset
The project includes a synthetic dataset (`data/dataset.csv`) for simulating node behaviors:

- *Features*: `uptime`, `past_faults`, `response_time`, `stake`
- *Labels*: `0` (Malicious), `1` (Honest)

## Goals
This PoC aims to explore the potential of integrating AI into blockchain consensus mechanisms, focusing on:

- Enhanced Security: Detecting and mitigating malicious behavior in real-time.
- Improved Efficiency: Optimizing leader selection and reducing computational overhead.
- Future Applications: Serving as a foundation for integrating AI with production-grade blockchain frameworks like Tendermint.
